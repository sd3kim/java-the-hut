### **Getting Started**

https://cafe-java-hut.herokuapp.com/home

Users can browse through the menu page to select a hot/cold drink or fresh baked good, with options to select a size or customize the drink to your liking! The cart page will allow users to view their added items, with the option to remove if desired. When the user is all set to check out, the 'Order' button can be pressed displaying a nice "Thank You" message and showing the contents of the order.

---

### **Next Steps**

- Implement OAUTH as a sign in feature.
  - View past orders.
  - Orders not checked out will be saved if the user logs out.
  - User reward page linked to OAUTH.
- Show total price of order.
- Quantity button in the cart to avoid repated items.
- When adding product to cart, show notification/alert that the order has been added.
